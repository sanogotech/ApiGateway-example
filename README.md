## API  Gateway  Process

Step 1 - The client sends an HTTP request to the API gateway.


Step 2 - The API gateway parses and validates the attributes in the HTTP request.


Step 3 - The API gateway performs allow-list/deny-list checks.


Step 4 - The API gateway talks to an identity provider for authentication and authorization.


Step 5 - The rate limiting rules are applied to the request. If it is over the limit, the request is rejected.


Steps 6 and 7 - Now that the request has passed basic checks, the API gateway finds the relevant service to route to by path matching.


Step 8 - The API gateway transforms the request into the appropriate protocol and sends it to backend microservices.


Steps 9-12: The API gateway can handle errors properly, and deals with faults if the error takes a longer time to recover (circuit break). It can also leverage ELK (Elastic-Logstash-Kibana) stack for logging and monitoring. We sometimes cache data in the API gateway.

## API Gateway between a client and our services/functions

By placing API Gateway between a client and our services/functions we can have a centralized component that will be responsible for API management, logging, authentication/authorization, rate limiting and load balancing and distributed tracing. However, we will introduce a component that can become a single point of failure to our system, so we need to deploy at least two replicas of it to have high availability and scale up depending on load.
